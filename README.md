Problem Statement
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Make a simulation of small creatures (wolves/ants/etc) controlled by neural networks. 
Evolve them with a genetic algorithm, and train them to find food/not die (so they need to keep track of hunger and die accordingly).
Kudos if you can add predator/prey relationships.
C/C++, you can use any graphics lib you want. I suggest SFML since it's very lightweight.
